My housemate was gifted a Samsung Active 2 Watch for her birthday. She wasn't too thrilled about it, so I asked if I could play around with it. It has an accelerometer, so I started thinking about using it for MIDI aftertouch effects using the accelerometer. I searched the Samsung app store to see if there were any existing apps with similar features. I discovered that the number of apps currently available was quite small, and unsurprisingly, there were no music-related apps whatsoever. Most items in the store are either watch face skins or fitness trackers.
