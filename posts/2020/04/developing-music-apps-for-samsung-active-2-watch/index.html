                <p>My housemate was gifted a Samsung Active 2 Watch for her birthday.
She wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled about it, and I knew it had an accelerometer, so I asked if I could play around with it.
I started thinking about using it for MIDI aftertouch effects using the accelerometer.
I searched the Samsung app store to see if there were any existing apps with similar features.
I discovered that the number of apps currently available was quite small, and unsurprisingly,
there were no music-related apps whatsoever. Most items in the store were either watch face skins or
fitness trackers.</p>
<p>My first step was to download Tizen Studio from Samsung and install it on my iMac. The installation was fairly painless.
Ideally, my goal was to create a native app for the watch, written in C++, to connect directly to the computer to transfer MIDI
information via bluetooth, without the need to connect to a separate phone app. After some troubleshooting (sometimes the watch
would skip asking for permissions, making it impossible to connect), I was able to connect and load the first template app, &ldquo;Hello Tizen&rdquo;
onto the watch. The next step is to figure out how to make different UI elements to display relevent info and for debug purposes.</p>
<p>Once I become more familiar with this development environment I may write a tutorial as a future post so that others don&rsquo;t have to struggle to find answers like I did.</p>
<p>To be continued&hellip;</p>
