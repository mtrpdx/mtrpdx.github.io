      <description>My housemate was gifted a Samsung Active 2 Watch for her birthday. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t too thrilled about it, and I knew it had an accelerometer, so I asked if I could play around with it. I started thinking about using it for MIDI aftertouch effects using the accelerometer. I searched the Samsung app store to see if there were any existing apps with similar features. I discovered that the number of apps currently available was quite small, and unsurprisingly, there were no music-related apps whatsoever.</description>
